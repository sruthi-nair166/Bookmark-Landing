## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript (for tabs, FAQ, validation)


### What I learned

This project really helped me understand:

- How to structure semantic, accessible HTML
- Managing tabbed content with `aria-selected` and `role="tablist"`
- Creating collapsible FAQ sections
- Using .checkValidity() for native form validation
- How to test and optimize performance and SEO using Lighthouse


### Continued development

I want to continue refining:

- Accessibility practices like screen reader support
- Animating tab/FAQ transitions more smoothly
